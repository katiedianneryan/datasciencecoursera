#Week One
###Learning Objectives
By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Write an if-else expression
- Write a for loop, a while loop, and a repeat loop
- Define a function in R and specify its return value [see Functions Part 1 and Part 2]
- Describe how R binds a value to a symbol via the search list
- Define what lexical scoping is with respect to how the value of free variables are resolved in R
- Describe the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping rules
- Convert a character string representing a date/time into an R datetime object. [see Dates and Times]

##Introduction
- Control Structures control the flow of a program for when you are setting up a longer program to happen (not interactive as we have been), they include things like:
  1. if, else (test logical conditions)
  2. for (execute a loop a fixed number of times)
  3. while (executes a loop while a condition is true)
  4. repeat (allows to infinite loop)
  5. break (breaks out of any loop)
  6. next (goes to the next loop)
  7. return (exits a loop)

##If-Else
* If  logical conditions and makes the R program do something if it is True (if true then x)
* You can combine this with else if you want there to be an alternate option (or else, if false, y)
* You can also combine multiple conditions with else if (condition2)


> if(x>3) {

>       y <- 10

> } else {

>       y <- 0

> }

OR YOU CAN ALSO DO THIS:


> y <- if(x>3) {

>       10

> } else {

>       0

> }

* do not always need else function, can just test and have a single result
